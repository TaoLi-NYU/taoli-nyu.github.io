**Bio:** I am an assistant professor in the Department of Systems Engineering and the Department of Data Science (by courtesy) at City University of Hong Kong. I was a visiting researcher at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, collaborating with the Mathematical Sciences and Quantum Computing divisions in the summer of 2025. I earned my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from New York University, advised by [Quanyan Zhu](https://wp.nyu.edu/quanyan/). My [dissertation](https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/computational-foundations-multi-agent-learning/docview/3213716172/se-2) examines the triad of information, decision, and uncertainty in multi-agent learning. Prior to my doctoral studies, I conducted research in computational harmonic analysis under the supervision of [Bin Han](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~bhan/) at the University of Alberta. I hold a B.S. in Mathematics, graduating summa cum laude from Xiamen University.

**My Erdős Number is 3**: Paul Erdős (0) coauthored "[On chagnes of signs in infinite series](https://doi.org/10.1007/bf01904853)" (1978) with [Charles K. Chui](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2wSd9-MAAAAJ&hl=en) (1), who coauthored "[A dual-chain approach for bottom–up construction of wavelet filters with any integer dilation](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acha.2011.11.004)" (2012) with [Bin Han](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HB3YA4gAAAAJ&hl=en)  (2), who coauthored "[Directional compactly supported box spline tight framelets with simple geometric structure](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aml.2018.12.016)" (2019) with me (3).

**Research Overview:** 
> My research develops computational foundations of **[mulit-agent learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9833086/)** under complex **[information structures](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1367578822000086)** to achieve certified robustness and resilience in AI-integrated network systems across **[cyber](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10955193)**, **[physical](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11153748)**, and **[huamn](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11091502)** layers.


**Prospective Students**: I am always actively looking for self-motivated students to join my research group as **PhD students**, **research assistants** (long/short-term/remote), and **interns**. We welcome applicants with 
- strong mathematical backgrounds in reinforcement learning, control and optimization, and game theory, and/or 
- practical experience with RL algorithms, large language models (foundation models), and simulation platforms in cybersecurity (e.g., those included in this [repo](https://github.com/Limmen/awesome-rl-for-cybersecurity?tab=readme-ov-file#-environments)), vehicular, and traffic simulation (e.g., CARLA and SUMO).
