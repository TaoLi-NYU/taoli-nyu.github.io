My research aims to develop a <b> game-theoretic resilient learning and control </b> paradigm to equip next-generation cyber-physical systems (CPS), such as multi-domain networks, intelligent transportation, and distributed AI systems, with decentralized proactive intelligence that adapts to dynamic and possibly adversarial environments with resiliency guarantees. Contributing to theoretical foundations of <b> multi-agent learning under amorphous information </b>, my dissertation advances novel methodologies and frameworks on predictive learning, non-equilibrium analysis, and meta-learning control for resilient CPS design, defense, and management. 


**Bio:** I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at New York University, working with [Quanyan Zhu](https://wp.nyu.edu/quanyan/). Before doing my PhD, I worked on [computational harmonic analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893965918304221) with [Bin Han](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~bhan/) at University of Alberta. I received the BS degree in Mathematics from Xiamen University. 

**Open to work!** I am on the 2024-2025 job market; please feel free to drop me a message if you feel I'm a good fit.
