**Bio:** I am currently a visiting researcher at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, collaborating with the Mathematical Sciences and Quantum Computing divisions. I recently earned my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from New York University, advised by [Quanyan Zhu](https://wp.nyu.edu/quanyan/). My [dissertation](https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/computational-foundations-multi-agent-learning/docview/3213716172/se-2) examines the triad of information, decision, and uncertainty in multi-agent learning. Prior to my doctoral studies, I conducted research in computational harmonic analysis under the supervision of [Bin Han](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~bhan/) at the University of Alberta. I hold a B.S. in Mathematics, graduating summa cum laude from Xiamen University.

**My Erdős Number is 3**: Paul Erdős (0) coauthored "[On chagnes of signs in infinite series](https://doi.org/10.1007/bf01904853)" (1978) with [Charles K. Chui](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2wSd9-MAAAAJ&hl=en) (1), who coauthored "[A dual-chain approach for bottom–up construction of wavelet filters with any integer dilation](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acha.2011.11.004)" (2012) with [Bin Han](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HB3YA4gAAAAJ&hl=en)  (2), who coauthored "[Directional compactly supported box spline tight framelets with simple geometric structure](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aml.2018.12.016)" (2019) with me (3).

**Research Overview:** 
> My research develops computational foundations of **mulit-agent learning**  under complex **information structures** to achieve certified **robustness and resilience**.


 Leveraging techniques from reinforcement learning (RL) and artificial intelligence (AI), game theory, and control & optimization, my research advances [<b>multi-agent learning in complex networks</b>](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcontrol.2022.03.003) with applications to cyber, physical, and human layers, including [<b>cybersecurity & resilience</b>](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10955193), [<b>intelligent transporation systems</b>](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trc.2024.104804), and [<b>social networks misinformation detection & mitigation</b>](https://doi.org/10.23919/WiOpt58741.2023.10349848). 
 
 My future research will utilize [<b>digital twin (DT)</b>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15025) technologies and advanced generative AI models, such as [<b>large language models (LLMs)</b>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10570), to enhance the implementability of the developed agentic frameworks for human-centered, resilient autonomous mobility management in complex urban environments.
