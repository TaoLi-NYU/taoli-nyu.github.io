**Bio:** I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at New York University, working with [Quanyan Zhu](https://wp.nyu.edu/quanyan/). Before doing my PhD, I worked on [computational harmonic analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893965918304221) with [Bin Han](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~bhan/) at University of Alberta. I received the BS degree in Mathematics from Xiamen University. 

**Research Overview:** My research aims to develop <b>computational foundations of agent-based technologies</b> with self-improving and self-healing abilities to facilitate <b>autonomous cyber-physical-human systems security and resilience</b> without human interventions. Leveraging techniques from reinforcement learning (RL) and artificial intelligence (AI), game theory, and control & optimization, my research advances [<b>multi-agent learning in complex networks</b>](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcontrol.2022.03.003) with applications to cyber, physical, and human layers, including [<b>cybersecurity & resilience</b>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12499), [<b>intelligent transporation systems</b>](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trc.2024.104804), and [<b>social networks misinformation detection & mitigation</b>](https://doi.org/10.23919/WiOpt58741.2023.10349848). My future research will utilize [<b>digital twin (DT)</b>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15025) technologies and advanced generative AI models, such as [<b>large language models (LLMs)</b>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10570), to enhance the implementability of the developed agentic frameworks for human-centered, resilient autonomous mobility management in complex urban environments.
