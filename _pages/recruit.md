## **2026 Fall Spring PhD Opening**
I am looking for students joining my research group starting from 2026 Fall. All Ph.D. positions are fully funded. Exceptionally qualified Ph.D. applicants will be encouraged to apply for the [Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme (HKPFS)](https://cerg1.ugc.edu.hk/hkpfs/index.html). Please contact me if you want to give a try.

In addition to HKPFS, CityU now offers a special PhD application track for applicants with a bachelorâ€™s degree from **C9 League** (THU, PKU, SJTU, FDU, ZJU, NJU, USTC, XJTU, HIT), **UCAS**, and QS/THE Top 20 universities, featuring an expedited offer process and a much higher scholarship. Applicants interested in this opportunity should contact me as soon as possible, since the quota is very limited.
