Urban transportation networks are inherently complex and dynamic, characterized by intricate road connections and diverse network structures coupled with time-variant traffic demands and frequent traffic incidents. Hence, offline planning or designing alone cannot guarantee real-time operational control and management of urban transportation systems, which may fail when physical attacks, unforeseen conditions, or unanticipated use places the system outside the design envelope. A desired real-time operation mechanism must adapt to the dynamic environment and determine management decisions to be executed while a system is running; i.e., input data arising over time have to be processed, and decisions have to be made before all input data are known. Such a decision-making process falls within the realm of online optimization or online learning. 

Motivated by several intelligent transportation applications from our past research projects, this tutorial aims to provide a gentle introduction to online optimization methods with much emphasis on the intuitive insights and relevance to transportation applications. The tutorial starts with gradient descent algorithms in conventional convex optimization and then moves to online gradient descent in online optimization problems. Extending from the single-agent online optimization, we briefly touch upon multi-agent online learning and associated equilibrium convergence. We conclude the tutorial by discussing the openings and challenges when deploying online optimization in urban transportation systems.}

abstract = {Security of cyber-physical network systems, such as 5G/6G communication networks, vehicular networks, and the Internet of Things, has become increasingly critical nowadays. Traditional security mechanisms rely primarily on manual operations, which can be slow, expensive, and ineffective in the face of the dynamic landscape of adversarial threats. This problem will only be exacerbated as attackers leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to automate their workflows. As a countermeasure, safeguarding critical network systems also calls for autonomous defensive operations that delegate security decisions to AI agents. This talk presents our agent-based framework for autonomous attack detection and response using reinforcement learning (RL) and large language models (LLM). To address conventional RL's reactive nature, we propose a new RL paradigm, conjectural online RL (coRL), to equip the security agent with predictive power when dealing with the agent's epistemic uncertainty over the attacker's presence and actions. The intuition of coRL is to endogenize the epistemic uncertainty as part of the RL process: the agent maintains an internal world model as a conjecture of the uncertainty, and the learned conjecture produces valid predictions consistent with environment feedback induced by epistemic uncertainty. To mitigate the RL agent's reliance on stylized modeling and textual data pre-processing, we further incorporate LLMs into the agentic framework to deliver end-to-end autonomous cyber operations. We finally conclude the talk by discussing the path ahead to building fully autonomous security agents. }

  abstract ={In urban traffic management, the primary challenge of dynamically and efficiently monitoring traffic conditions is compounded by the insufficient utilization of thousands of surveillance cameras along the intelligent transportation system.  This paper introduces the multi-level Traffic-responsive Tilt Camera surveillance system (TTC-X), a novel framework designed for dynamic and efficient monitoring and management of traffic in urban networks. By leveraging widely deployed pan-tilt-cameras (PTCs), TTC-X overcomes the limitations of a fixed field of view in traditional surveillance systems by providing mobilized and 360-degree coverage. The innovation of TTC-X lies in the integration of advanced machine learning modules, including a detector-predictor-controller structure, with a novel Predictive Correlated Online Learning (PiCOL) methodology and the Spatial-Temporal Graph Predictor (STGP) for real-time traffic estimation and PTC control. The TTC-X is tested and evaluated under three experimental scenarios (e.g., maximum traffic flow capture, dynamic route planning, traffic state estimation) based on a simulation environment calibrated using real-world traffic data in Brooklyn, New York. The experimental results showed that TTC-X captured over 60\% total number of vehicles at the network level, dynamically adjusted its route recommendation in reaction to unexpected full-lane closure events, and reconstructed link-level traffic states with best MAE less than 1.25 vehicle/hour. Demonstrating scalability, cost-efficiency, and adaptability, TTC-X emerges as a powerful solution for urban traffic management in both cyber-physical and real-world environments.},
