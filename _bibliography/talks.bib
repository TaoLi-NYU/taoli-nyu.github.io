abstract  = {
Urban transportation networks are inherently complex and dynamic, characterized by intricate road connections and diverse network structures coupled with time-variant traffic demands and frequent traffic incidents. Hence, offline planning or designing alone cannot guarantee real-time operational control and management of urban transportation systems, which may fail when physical attacks, unforeseen conditions, or unanticipated use places the system outside the design envelope. A desired real-time operation mechanism must adapt to the dynamic environment and determine management decisions to be executed while a system is running; i.e., input data arising over time have to be processed, and decisions have to be made before all input data are known. Such a decision-making process falls within the realm of online optimization or online learning. 

Motivated by several intelligent transportation applications from our past research projects, this tutorial aims to provide a gentle introduction to online optimization methods with much emphasis on the intuitive insights and relevance to transportation applications. The tutorial starts with gradient descent algorithms in conventional convex optimization and then moves to online gradient descent in online optimization problems. Extending from the single-agent online optimization, we briefly touch upon multi-agent online learning and associated equilibrium convergence. We conclude the tutorial by discussing the openings and challenges when deploying online optimization in urban transportation systems.}

abstract = {Security of cyber-physical network systems, such as 5G/6G communication networks, vehicular networks, and the Internet of Things, has become increasingly critical nowadays. Traditional security mechanisms rely primarily on manual operations, which can be slow, expensive, and ineffective in the face of the dynamic landscape of adversarial threats. This problem will only be exacerbated as attackers leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to automate their workflows. As a countermeasure, safeguarding critical network systems also calls for autonomous defensive operations that delegate security decisions to AI agents. This talk presents our agent-based framework for autonomous attack detection and response using reinforcement learning (RL) and large language models (LLM). To address conventional RL's reactive nature, we propose a new RL paradigm, conjectural online RL (coRL), to equip the security agent with predictive power when dealing with the agent's epistemic uncertainty over the attacker's presence and actions. The intuition of coRL is to endogenize the epistemic uncertainty as part of the RL process: the agent maintains an internal world model as a conjecture of the uncertainty, and the learned conjecture produces valid predictions consistent with environment feedback induced by epistemic uncertainty. To mitigate the RL agent's reliance on stylized modeling and textual data pre-processing, we further incorporate LLMs into the agentic framework to deliver end-to-end autonomous cyber operations. We finally conclude the talk by discussing the path ahead to building fully autonomous security agents. }

@inproceedings{cityu,
title = {Conjectural Online Learning in Asymmetric Information Stochastic Games},
booktitle = {Systems Engineering Department Seminar Series},
location  = {City University of Hongkong, Hong Kong},
month = {Oct},
year = {2024},
abstract = {Modern socio-technical network systems powered by artificial intelligence (AI) technologies feature sophisticated interactions among humans, AI agents, and system entities. Asymmetric information stochastic games (AISG) provide principled mathematical modeling for such interactions, leading to game-theoretical mechanisms for network management. However, existing computational and learning methods in asymmetric information stochastic games (AISG) are primarily offline without adaptability to online nonstationarity, which falls short of proactive intelligence for resilient network management. To address these limitations, we propose conjectural online learning (COL), an online learning framework for generic AISGs. COL uses a forecaster-actor-critic (FAC) architecture, where the forecaster conjectures the other agents' strategies and system dynamics within a look-ahead horizon, representing the agent's subjective (mis)perception of the AISG. Based on these subjective perceptions, COL employs online rollout (actor-critic) to improve the policy. Bayesian learning is then used to calibrate the conjectures using information feedback. We establish that the conjectures produced by COL are asymptotically consistent with the information feedback in the sense of a relaxed Bayesian consistency. We deploy COL in a nonstationary IT infrastructure digital twin, which delivers online adaptable defense against advanced persistent threats compared with benchmark reinforcement learning techniques. }

title = {{Conjectural Online Learning with First-order Beliefs in Stochastic Games}},
location = {Coordinated Science Laboratory, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, IL},
month = {Aug},
year  = {2024},
abstract = {Existing computational methods for asymmetric information stochastic games (AISG) are primarily offline and can not adapt to equilibrium deviations. Further, current methods are limited to particular information structures to avoid belief hierarchies. Considering these limitations, we propose conjectural online learning (COL), an online learning method under generic information structures in AISGs. COL uses a forecaster-actor-critic architecture, where subjective forecasts are used to conjecture the opponents' strategies within a lookahead horizon, and Bayesian learning is used to calibrate the conjectures. To adapt strategies to nonstationary environments based on information feedback, COL uses online rollout with cost function approximation (actor-critic). We prove that the conjectures produced by COL are asymptotically consistent with the information feedback in the sense of a relaxed Bayesian consistency. We also prove that the empirical strategy profile induced by COL converges to the Berk-Nash equilibrium, a solution concept characterizing rationality under subjectivity.}

@inproceedings{caltech,
title = {{Automated Security Response Through Conjectural Online Learning under Information Asymmetry }},
location = {Autonomous Robotics and Control Lab, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA},
month = {Jun},
year  = {2024},
abstract = {We study automated security response for an IT infrastructure and formulate the interaction between an attacker and a defender as a partially observed, non-stationary game. We relax the standard assumption that the game model is correctly specified and consider that each player has a probabilistic conjecture about the model, which may be misspecified in the sense that the true model has probability 0. This formulation allows us to capture uncertainty and misconception about the infrastructure and the intents of the players. To learn effective game strategies online, we design Conjectural Online Learning (COL), a novel method where a player iteratively adapts its conjecture using Bayesian learning and updates its strategy through rollout. We prove that the conjectures converge to best fits, and we provide a bound on the performance improvement that rollout enables with a conjectured model. To characterize the steady state of the game, we propose a variant of the Berk-Nash equilibrium. We present COL through an advanced persistent threat use case. Testbed evaluations show that COL produces effective security strategies that adapt to a changing environment. We also find that COL enables faster convergence than current reinforcement learning techniques.}

abstract = {In urban traffic management, the primary challenge of dynamically and efficiently monitoring traffic conditions is compounded by the insufficient utilization of thousands of surveillance cameras along the intelligent transportation system.  This paper introduces the multi-level Traffic-responsive Tilt Camera surveillance system (TTC-X), a novel framework designed for dynamic and efficient monitoring and management of traffic in urban networks. By leveraging widely deployed pan-tilt-cameras (PTCs), TTC-X overcomes the limitations of a fixed field of view in traditional surveillance systems by providing mobilized and 360-degree coverage. The innovation of TTC-X lies in the integration of advanced machine learning modules, including a detector-predictor-controller structure, with a novel Predictive Correlated Online Learning (PiCOL) methodology and the Spatial-Temporal Graph Predictor (STGP) for real-time traffic estimation and PTC control. The TTC-X is tested and evaluated under three experimental scenarios (e.g., maximum traffic flow capture, dynamic route planning, traffic state estimation) based on a simulation environment calibrated using real-world traffic data in Brooklyn, New York. The experimental results showed that TTC-X captured over 60\% total number of vehicles at the network level, dynamically adjusted its route recommendation in reaction to unexpected full-lane closure events, and reconstructed link-level traffic states with best MAE less than 1.25 vehicle/hour. Demonstrating scalability, cost-efficiency, and adaptability, TTC-X emerges as a powerful solution for urban traffic management in both cyber-physical and real-world environments.}
