abstract = {{We study automated security response for an IT infrastructure and formulate the interaction between an attacker and a defender as a partially observed, non-stationary game. We relax the standard assumption that the game model is correctly specified and consider that each player has a probabilistic conjecture about the model, which may be misspecified in the sense that the true model has probability 0. This formulation allows us to capture uncertainty about the infrastructure and the intents of the players. To learn effective game strategies online, we design a novel method where a player iteratively adapts its conjecture using Bayesian learning and updates its strategy through rollout. We prove that the conjectures converge to best fits, and we provide a bound on the performance improvement that rollout enables with a conjectured model. To characterize the steady state of the game, we propose a variant of the Berk-Nash equilibrium. We present our method through an advanced persistent threat use case. Simulation studies based on testbed measurements show that our method produces effective security strategies that adapt to a changing environment. We also find that our method enables faster convergence than current reinforcement learning techniques.}},

abstract = {{Multi-domain warfare is a military doctrine that leverages capabilities from different domains, including air, land, sea, space, and cyberspace, to create a highly interconnected battle network that is difficult for adversaries to disrupt or defeat. However, the adoption of 5G technologies on battlefields presents new vulnerabilities due to the complexity of interconnections and the diversity of software, hardware, and devices from different supply chains. Therefore, establishing a zero-trust architecture for 5G-enabled networks is crucial for continuous monitoring and fast data analytics to protect against targeted attacks. To address these challenges, we propose a proactive end-to-end security scheme that utilizes a 5G satellite-guided air-ground network. Our approach incorporates a decision-dominant learning-based method that can thwart the lateral movement of adversaries targeting critical assets on the battlefield before they can conduct reconnaissance or gain necessary access or credentials. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our game-theoretic design, which uses a meta-learning framework to enable zero-trust monitoring and decision-dominant defense against attackers in emerging multi-domain battlefield networks.}},

abstract = {{Traditional mobility management strategies emphasize macro-level mobility oversight from traffic-sensing infrastructures, often overlooking safety risks that directly affect road users. To address this, we propose a Digital Twin-based Driver Risk-Aware Intelligent Mobility Analytics (DT-DIMA) system. The DT-DIMA system integrates real-time traffic information from pan-tilt-cameras (PTCs), synchronizes this data into a digital twin to accurately replicate the physical world, and predicts network-wide mobility and safety risks in real time. The system's innovation lies in its integration of spatial-temporal modeling, simulation, and online control modules. Tested and evaluated under normal traffic conditions and incidental situations (e.g., unexpected accidents, pre-planned work zones) in a simulated testbed in Brooklyn, New York, DT-DIMA demonstrated mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) ranging from 8.40\% to 15.11\% in estimating network-level traffic volume and MAPEs from 0.85\% to 12.97\% in network-level safety risk prediction. In addition, the highly accurate safety risk prediction enables PTCs to preemptively monitor road segments with high driving risks before incidents take place. Such proactive PTC surveillance creates around a 5-minute lead time in capturing traffic incidents. The DT-DIMA system enables transportation managers to understand mobility not only in terms of traffic patterns but also driver-experienced safety risks, allowing for proactive resource allocation in response to various traffic situations. To the authors' best knowledge, DT-DIMA is the first urban mobility management system that considers both mobility and safety risks based on digital twin architecture.}},

abstract = {{This article considers a game-theoretic framework for distributed empirical risk minimization (ERM) problems over networks where the information acquisition at a node is modeled as a rational choice of a player. In the proposed game, players decide both the learning parameters and the network structure. The Nash equilibrium (NE) characterizes the tradeoff between the local performance and the global agreement of the learned classifiers. We first introduce an interleaved approach that features a joint learning process that integrates the iterative learning at each node with the network formation. We show that our game is equivalent to a generalized potential game in the setting of undirected networks. We study the convergence of the proposed interleaved algorithm, analyze the network structures determined by our game, and show the improvement of social welfare compared to a standard distributed ERM over fixed networks. To adapt our framework to streaming data, we derive a distributed Kalman filter. A concurrent algorithm based on the online mirror descent algorithm is also introduced to solve for NE in a holistic manner. In the case study, we use data from telemonitoring of Parkinson's disease to corroborate the results.}},

abstract = {{Multi-agent learning (MAL) studies how agents learn to behave optimally and adaptively from their experience when interacting with other agents in dynamic environments. The outcome of a MAL process is jointly determined by all agents’ decision-making. Hence, each agent needs to think strategically about others’ sequential moves, when planning future actions. The strategic interactions among agents makes MAL go beyond the direct extension of single-agent learning to multiple agents. With the strategic thinking, each agent aims to build a subjective model of others decision-making using its observations. Such modeling is directly influenced by agents’ perception during the learning process, which is called the information structure of the agent’s learning. As it determines the input to MAL processes, information structures play a significant role in the learning mechanisms of the agents. This review creates a taxonomy of MAL and establishes a unified and systematic way to understand MAL from the perspective of information structures. We define three fundamental components of MAL: the information structure (i.e., what the agent can observe), the belief generation (i.e., how the agent forms a belief about others based on the observations), as well as the policy generation (i.e., how the agent generates its policy based on its belief). In addition, this taxonomy enables the classification of a wide range of state-of-the-art algorithms into four categories based on the belief-generation mechanisms of the opponents, including stationary, conjectured, calibrated, and sophisticated opponents. We introduce Value of Information (VoI) as a metric to quantify the impact of different information structures on MAL. Finally, we discuss the strengths and limitations of algorithms from different categories and point to promising avenues of future research.}},
