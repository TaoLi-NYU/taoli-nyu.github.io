abstract = {{We study automated security response for an IT infrastructure and formulate the interaction between an attacker and a defender as a partially observed, non-stationary game. We relax the standard assumption that the game model is correctly specified and consider that each player has a probabilistic conjecture about the model, which may be misspecified in the sense that the true model has probability 0. This formulation allows us to capture uncertainty about the infrastructure and the intents of the players. To learn effective game strategies online, we design a novel method where a player iteratively adapts its conjecture using Bayesian learning and updates its strategy through rollout. We prove that the conjectures converge to best fits, and we provide a bound on the performance improvement that rollout enables with a conjectured model. To characterize the steady state of the game, we propose a variant of the Berk-Nash equilibrium. We present our method through an advanced persistent threat use case. Simulation studies based on testbed measurements show that our method produces effective security strategies that adapt to a changing environment. We also find that our method enables faster convergence than current reinforcement learning techniques.}},

abstract = {{Multi-domain warfare is a military doctrine that leverages capabilities from different domains, including air, land, sea, space, and cyberspace, to create a highly interconnected battle network that is difficult for adversaries to disrupt or defeat. However, the adoption of 5G technologies on battlefields presents new vulnerabilities due to the complexity of interconnections and the diversity of software, hardware, and devices from different supply chains. Therefore, establishing a zero-trust architecture for 5G-enabled networks is crucial for continuous monitoring and fast data analytics to protect against targeted attacks. To address these challenges, we propose a proactive end-to-end security scheme that utilizes a 5G satellite-guided air-ground network. Our approach incorporates a decision-dominant learning-based method that can thwart the lateral movement of adversaries targeting critical assets on the battlefield before they can conduct reconnaissance or gain necessary access or credentials. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our game-theoretic design, which uses a meta-learning framework to enable zero-trust monitoring and decision-dominant defense against attackers in emerging multi-domain battlefield networks.}},

abstract = {{This article considers a game-theoretic framework for distributed empirical risk minimization (ERM) problems over networks where the information acquisition at a node is modeled as a rational choice of a player. In the proposed game, players decide both the learning parameters and the network structure. The Nash equilibrium (NE) characterizes the tradeoff between the local performance and the global agreement of the learned classifiers. We first introduce an interleaved approach that features a joint learning process that integrates the iterative learning at each node with the network formation. We show that our game is equivalent to a generalized potential game in the setting of undirected networks. We study the convergence of the proposed interleaved algorithm, analyze the network structures determined by our game, and show the improvement of social welfare compared to a standard distributed ERM over fixed networks. To adapt our framework to streaming data, we derive a distributed Kalman filter. A concurrent algorithm based on the online mirror descent algorithm is also introduced to solve for NE in a holistic manner. In the case study, we use data from telemonitoring of Parkinson's disease to corroborate the results.}},
