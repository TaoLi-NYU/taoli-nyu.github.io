I gave a talk on our recent efforts on multi-agent constrained correlated online learning for [traffic sensing and digital twin synchronization](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trc.2024.104804) at the [2025 annual East Coast Optimization Meeting (ECOM)](https://math.gmu.edu/~hantil/ECOM/2025/index.html). Thank NSF Divison of Mathematical Sciences for the travel grant.
