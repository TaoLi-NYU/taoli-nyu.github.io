Our work on [game-theoretic transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04579) won the best paper runner up at the 17th workshop on [Adaptive and Learning Agents](https://ala-workshop.github.io/#), co-located with AAMAS. Using the idea of self-confirming equilibrium in game theory, we are making offline MARL agents more adaptable when facing out-of-distribution opponents.
