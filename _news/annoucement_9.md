I presented our recent effort on [Risk-Aware Long-Short-Term Adaptive Twining in Urban Traffic Digital Twin](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15025) at the [Institute for Mathematical and Statistical Innovation](https://www.imsi.institute/activities/uncertainty-quantification-strategies-for-multi-physics-systems-and-digital-twins/#register) at University of Chicago. Thank the IMSI and NSF Divison of Mathematical Sciences for the travel grant.
