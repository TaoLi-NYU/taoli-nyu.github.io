I was selected to attend the 2025 National Science Foundation (NSF) Networking Technology and Systems Early-Career Investigators (NeTS-ECI) Workshop. I will present my research thrusts on agent-based autonomous network security. You are more than welcome to join the [Network Security session](https://sites.google.com/view/nets-early-career-2025/agenda?authuser=0) or drop me a message if you are interested.
