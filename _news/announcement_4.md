I gave a talk on the Traffic-responsive Title Camera (TTC) Surveillance system at [NYU Urban Research Day](https://www.nyu.edu/academics/scholarly-strengths/urban-initiative/events/urban-research-day-2022.html). TTC aims to make NYCâ€™s cameras (more than 15000) smarter for high-precision real-time traffic situational awareness.
